# Leetcode-Solutions

LeetCode is a website where people–mostly software engineers–practice their coding skills. There are 800+ questions (and growing), each with multiple solutions. Questions are ranked by level of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.

Initially, I want to point out a situation that I am not a pro-programmer! I'm adding these solutions for everyone who wants to be benefited, including me! These are my solutions for problems from LeetCode. I'll try to add more and solutions gradually. Also, I kept it open for all. So, you can obviously commit or fork it out. Sometimes, as much I have experienced, we all need help to find solution of a particular problem or we want to check other avialable solutions to find the most efficient one. I am not saying that these are the most efficient solution, but I hope these solutions will help you out in some way. Also, I'll be honored if you suggest another algorithm to solve a particular problem. So, each of your commit will help other programmers. Happy coding!
