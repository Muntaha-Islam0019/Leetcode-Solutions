# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to coding problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), written in **Python**, **Java**, **C++**, and **Kotlin**.

I use this repo to:
- Practice data structures and algorithms
- Explore multiple problem-solving approaches
- Track my interview prep progress across different languages

---

### 💡 Highlights

- Multi-language solutions (Python, Java, C++, Kotlin)
- Flat structure — each file named after its problem
- Prioritizes readability and learning over strict optimization
